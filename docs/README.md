# AutoQ Framework Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. What is the AutoQ Framework?
The **AutoQ Framework** is a tool for automated quantum circuit optimization, designed to increase processing speed (measured in logical gates per µs) in quantum systems. It integrates standard techniques available as of April 2025, including transpilation, parallelism, and quantum error correction (QEC), into a unified pipeline. AutoQ is ideal for users who want to optimize quantum circuits simply and efficiently, without complex manual configurations.

### 1.2. Objective
AutoQ was developed to:
- Reduce the number of gates in quantum circuits.
- Execute operations in parallel, leveraging hardware connectivity.
- Minimize QEC overhead, adjusting it based on error rates.
- Maximize processing speed, with typical speedups of 2.2× to 3.5× (e.g., from 0.1 to 0.222 gates/µs in photonic systems).

### 1.3. Target Audience
- Researchers and developers in quantum computing.
- Users who want to optimize quantum circuits without advanced knowledge of transpilation or QEC.
- Teams working with simulations or quantum hardware (e.g., photonic, superconducting).
